Before continuing, please ensure that your system has the autoconfig suite
installed (autoconfig, automake, and autoheader), if your system is a Debian 
based distribution (such as Debian, Ubuntu, or Mint) this can be done by 
running the command:

	sudo apt-get install autoconf automake libtool make

Additionally, new versions of CPlus2ASP now depend on the Boost libraries 
version 1.44+. If you're running Ubuntu 11.10 (Oneiric) or later this can 
be done by using the command

	sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev

Otherwise, you should see if Boost 1.44+ has a package for your distribution 
or compile and install Boost from source (available at www.boost.org).


Finally, the system has requires Bison, Flex, and RE2C in order to create
many of the source files. Once again, the following command is sufficient
on Debian based installations:

	sudo apt-get install bison flex re2c

In order to install CPlus2ASP, you can run the command

	./bootstrap && ./configure && make && sudo make install

on systems with sudo installed, or the command

	./bootstrap && ./configure && make && su -c "make install"

on other systems assuming you have access to the root account.

The system requires as2transition to run correctly. If your system has Git
then as2transition will be downloaded and compiled automatically while execuiting
the command above. Otherwise, you will need to download the Zip file for
as2transition (located at https://github.com/babb517/as2transition/archive/master.zip),
unzip it, and link it to 'externals/as2transition' subdirectory. Assuming 
that you're in the directory containing your cplus2asp root directory, this 
can be done with the following commands:

	wget --output-document=as2transition.zip https://github.com/babb517/as2transition/archive/master.zip
	mkdir -p as2transition
	unzip as2transition.zip -d as2transition
	rmdir cplus2asp/externals/as2transition
	ln -s as2transition cplus2asp/externals/as2transition


Before running CPlus2ASP, you should also ensure your system has F2LP v1.3+ 
and iclingo v3.0.5+ installed as these are required for the regular operation 
of CPlus2ASP (clingo, gringo, and oclingo are also required for certain running 
modes). All of these can be obtained at the following locations:

	f2lp: 			http://reasoning.eas.asu.edu/f2lp/
	*clingo & gringo: 	http://potassco.sourceforge.net/
