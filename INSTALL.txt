In order to install system cplus2asp, please ensure that your system has autotools 
(autoconf, autoheader, automake, aclocal) installed (automake must be version 1.9 
or higher) and run the following command:
	./bootstrap && ./configure && make && sudo make install

The system requires as2transition to run correctly. If your system has Git then
as2transition will be downloaded and compiled automatically while execuiting
the command above. Otherwise, you will need to download the Zip file for
as2transition (located at https://github.com/babb517/as2transition/archive/master.zip),
unzip it, and link it to 'externals/as2transition' subdirectory. Assuming that you're
in the directory containing your cplus2asp root directory, this can be done with
the following commands:

	wget --output-document=as2transition.zip https://github.com/babb517/as2transition/archive/master.zip
	mkdir -p as2transition
	unzip as2transition.zip -d as2transition
	rmdir cplus2asp/externals/as2transition
	ln -s as2transition cplus2asp/externals/as2transition
